# Wu-Tang Name Generator

This project reinforces my understanding on the core concepts of OOP and Javascript ES6 features and their applications. I wanted to keep my code as compact as possible. I wanted to do a Neon theme for this project! The product came out clean, eye catching and fun! By the end of it. I'm excited for the future projects, so stay tuned!
